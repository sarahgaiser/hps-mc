To run this generator, you need a python3.8 virtual environment on s3df.
If you don't have one set up, you can do this by running

python3.8 -m venv python3.8_venv

Activate the virtual environment

source python3.8_venv/bin/activate

and install six (needed for MG5)

pip install six

Afterwards, the scripts in this directory should all work.
